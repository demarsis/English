Some people think that zoos are cruel and that animals should be left in their natural environment. Others say that zoos are important because they are the only place that most children will ever see real wild animals. What is your opinion on this issue?

I agree with the idea that all the zoos should be eliminated and the animals should be left in their natural environment.
Firstly, it is true that zoos are cruel for animals. Most of the animals from zoos live in terrible conditions without enough area, having an inappropriate climate and food. A lot of zoos cannot even provide enough meal like the one from Chisinau.
Secondly, all the zoos and the circuses as well were created only for entertainment when nobody cares about animals. Nowadays, we can replace all the zoos with television, books and internet, where every child can learn about animals in wild environment. For example, children can watch video in youtube or play video games. I also would advise everybody to have domestic animals like dogs and cats instead of visiting zoos.
On the other hand, sometimes we need to support such animals that are on the verge of extinction. In these cases, scientists or doctors can create a very close environment to animal's natural conditions. Moreover, the intervention must be very limited, only for special cases when the animals cannot live without human's care.
As a conclusion I would say that humanity can eliminate all the zoos all over the world and start caring about animals and the nature generally.
