Dear Sir/Madam,
I am writing you to complain about my apartment that I have rented at your letting agency. I was completely disappointed about it after moving in.
Firstly, the apartment is in really bad condition. The furniture is old, the door of the locker doesn't close, the chairs are broken and it is unsafe to use them. Seems that the shower in the bathroom is clogged because the water stream is low.
Secondly, the air conditioning doesn't work at all. It is the middle of the summer and it is very hot inside even when the window is open. The apartment is dirty and it was not cleaned before I moved in, so I had to clean it by myself.
I claim you to provide me another apartment with having no such problems that I described above as I paid you quite a lot. I hope you to solve the problem as soon as possible, otherwise I am going to return my money back and find another agency.
Sincerely yours,
Dmitrii
