There are a lot of things a man would like to achive: to be a great inventor, to be a rock star or even to fly on the Moon. One can do more, faster, higher - almost everything is possible. Except the time. Whatever you are going to do, you get a barrier of the lack of time. Life is too short to rely on a singleton.

Let's consider the greatest and the most popular phisycist in the world Albert Einstein. First of all he is known as an inventor of the Theory Of Relativity. Genius? Yes, no doubt. But everybody is aware of his wife, which did a huge part of his calculations needed to prove the theory.
Another good example is John Petrucci, the most intresting and technical guitar player in the world. He plays the guitar in a progressive metal band called Dream Theater. He travels all over the world with Dream Theater with unforgettable concerts playing very complex music. The main question is whether he could achieve this without his band which consists of very professional musicians as well. My answer is no. A agree with the statement and do think that nobody can achieve great things in lonelyness.
Neverless we should not deny the power of a talent and creativity of singletons - some of them can achieve more than big teams. They can inspire others and show the right way to move further. A power of a leader which can organize others to create something is really significant. But still the team work is very important, nobody can do his job alone without a support of others.
