You cannot achieve great things with talent alone. You must work hard and have the support of people around you. Do you agree with the statement?

There are a lot of things a man would like to achieve in his life, such as to be a rock star or even to fly to the Moon. One can do more, faster, higher, so almost everything is possible. In my opinion, the only talent is not enough, both working hard and having support of others are really necessary components of success.
I would like to consider the greatest and the most popular physicist in the world Albert Einstein. First of all, he is known as an inventor of the Theory of Relativity. No doubt that he was a real genius and put a lot of effort to develop his theory. Moreover, his wife Mileva did a huge part of his calculations needed to prove the theory, that means that Einstein had the support of her.
Another good example is John Petrucci, the most interesting and technical guitar player in the world. He plays the guitar in a progressive metal band called Dream Theater. He travels all over the world with Dream Theater with unforgettable concerts playing very complex music. The main question is whether he could achieve it without his band which consists of very professional musicians as well.
Nevertheless, we should not deny the power of a talent and creativity of singletons, some of them can achieve more than big teams. They can inspire others and show the right way to move further. A power of a leader which can organize others to create something is really significant. But still the team work is very important, nobody can do his job alone without the support of others.
In conclusion, I think that a talent is not enough to achieve something great, it is just another piece of puzzle. Whatever significant you are going to do, you need to work a lot, to be lucky and to have friends who always can help you.
