Should health care be free for everyone, or should people pay for the care they need?

Health care is one of the most important parts of a human life. In my opinion, it must be well paid by people using insurance mechanisms.
Firstly, there is no such an option as free medicine, in any case we pay for it directly or indirectly. If one has an insurance policy, he has already paid for his medicaments, doctors and medical service to an insurance company. Otherwise, he has to pay for everything directly to a hospital and his expenses can be very heavy. Sometimes we can expect free health care, but it is good to know that it was paid by somebody else.
Secondly, the health care insurance is a very fair system. Nowadays, the medicine has become very expensive domain, the technology is very complicated and requires qualificated human resources. One can be protected by it, thus regularly paying small amount of money, and when health problems come, he will be sure he will get all necessary care and medicaments.
On the other hand, there are some exceptions, such as dentists or expensive operations which are not covered by insurance contracts. In worst case scenario you can spend all your money for nothing. But at the end of the day the insurance system works in most of cases.
In conclusion I would say that governments of most progressive counties try to build the most effective system of health care. I consider private insurance as one of the best candidates for it.
