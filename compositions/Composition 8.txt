Children spend too much time watching television instead of participating in activities with other children and playing sports. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?

Some people think that the nowaday's children spend too much time watching television instead of participating in activities with other children or playing sports. I don't agree with these ideas as I can observe that it is not true.
Firstly, the contemporary children don't consider television as something interesting for spending time. Most of them prefer to use personal computers and mobile phones to watch cartoons or playing games. My friend's daughter had learned how to use iIpad before she could even walk. She could launch youtube and play different videos without any external help. Only her parents had to control the time she spends on watching. Moreover, she never asked to watch any TV channels.
Secondly, many parents encourage their children to do sports or different activities such as: dancing, playing chess, fighting sections, swimming, etc. These are the best places for children socializing, where they can play and talk. Later they often meet and spend time together as friends. My another friend's son swim in a pool with another children and they are good friends. They communicate both online spending time together and offline in social networks.
Comparing with my childhood, I can make a conclusion that nowaday's children watch TV less than our generation. I can recall those times when I watched TV for 2-3 hours in a day. The children prefer computers and mobile phones that I didn't have in my childhood. That is the great result of the technical progress.
