my opinion, conclusion

All people in the world have to learn new things during all the life. Learning quickly means being a successful person and a lot of people are worried about how to do it the easiest way.
In childhood our brain is very flexible and ready to absorb everything around it. That is why we go to school in young ages having many hours in studing. Futhermore some parents want thier kids to attend additional courses, such as foreign languages, dancing, art, music, etc. They believe that this is the best way to give their children best opportunities in the future. When I meet such a kid I always regret about his missed childhood.
On the other hand the adults are more experienced of life that means they can directly choose one subject they want to study. Moreover they can much, unite and group the information, make notes, discuss in groups new ideas. It appears the possibilities that cannot achieve a young man which doesn't have experience of studing tricks. For instance some of my friends who had been flunkies at school found their interests in aduld life and became good professionals. They had to learn a lot and hard, but on the other hand they had a great motivation to have a good profession.
From my experience I can say that in the childhood it was much easier to learn new things. For example I could remember 20 new English words in a day. Now it became not so easy as I had to attempt some more times before I can remember a new word properly. But at the end of the day in childhood I didn't have reasons to learn English and this leaning was not so efficient as it is now.
In conclusion I would say that everybody of us have to learn all the life, even when it is hard and takes much time.
