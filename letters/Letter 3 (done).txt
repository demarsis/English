Dear Sir/Madam,
I am writing to apply for the technician position advertised in yesterday's newspaper.
My name is Dmitrii, I am 28. I graduated from Technical University of Moldova five years ago and have a master's degree in Information Technology. I was one of the best students, especially in programming and computer science.
Since the age of twenty I have worked with different equipment, such as computers, laptops and printers. I have helped the staff to install and set up digital cameras and projectors, which is my favorite part of my work. Also, I have experience in web technologies and I am familiar with maintaining sites.
I am a friendly and communicative person and I really enjoy helping people. I am sure that my personal and professional skills will be very useful for your company. I look forward to hearing from you and ready to attend an interview at any time.
Yours sincerely,
Dmitrii Oprea
