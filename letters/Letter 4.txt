Dear Mr. Black,
I am writing you to ask for two weeks off starting from the next week. Currently I am studing on a full-time course as a software engineer. Unfortunately, I cannot attend the lessons these days and I have to leave the country.
The thing is that I often play the national lottery and at the end of the last month I was lucky to win two tickets of a cruise trip. It will take exactly two weeks: a dream vacation with my lovely wife. We are starting the trip from Egypt and going to visit Turkey, Italy, France and Spain. We also have all-inclusive service, four free massage sessions and two swimming lessons with private trainer.
I hope you will be so kind to approve me these two weeks off. I also want to assure you that I am going to continue studying and I am going to take the most important textbooks on board. Moreover I have arranged for two Skype lessons with Mr. Bean and 5 lessons with Mrs. Cameron. 
Yours sincerely,
Dmitrii Oprea
