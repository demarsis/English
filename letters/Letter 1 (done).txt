Hello Mr and Mrs Smith,

I am writing to inform you that I am coming next Sunday at 9 a.m.
My name is Dmitrii and I am 28. I live in Chisinau, which is the capital of Moldova. It is a little and very green country in the east of Europe.
My family is not big, but it is very friendly. I have a lovely wife and kind parents. I am the only child and in my childhood I dreamt about having a brother or a sister, but my parents did not think so. I know that your family is bigger than mine and I hope to meet them all. By the way, I really like playing the guitar. Don't you mind if I take it? Usually I play it in the evening. I want to play some of my songs to you and hope you will like my singing. And if you do not like the noise I can play somewhere outside.
Could you meet me at the airport, please? I have never been to your city before and do not want to get lost. I am also sending you my photo to be sure you can recognize me.

Best wishes,
Dmitrii
