Dear Mrs. Black,
I am writing to complain about students living in your renting house. I hope we can manage the situation without any difficulties having only your participation.
Firstly, I want to describe my new neighbours. They are three students who hardly speak English and don't even greet us when we meet each other outside. They are very aggressive and seem very dangerous. I am afraid they can kill my cat when I am not at home.
Secondly, they like to listen to music very loudly. Almost every day I can hear the bass coming through the walls and I find that very annoying. Yesterday I tried to speak to them about that, but they didn't want to open the door. Moreover, I suspect that they were smoking marihuana as I could smell the smoke.
At the end of the day I wanted to call the police and then I decided to write you first. Do you think we can manage the situation? I would really appreciate if you speak to them or find other lodgers.
Sincerely yours,
Dmitrii
