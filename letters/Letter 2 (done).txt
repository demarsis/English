Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to complain about my lessons I took at Learn Fast Driving School. 
I had only 6 one-hour driving lessons and I didn't like my instructors. I was very surprised when I got a new instructor for the second lesson. And again a new one was changed to the third one. I even could not remember their names! Two of them were always late and I had to wait them near the car. I caught a cold and could not work properly for a week. My first instructor talked too much, so we did not even start the engine.
Also, I got an old car and from time to time I could hear a very strange noise out of the bonnet and I am sure it was dangerous to drive. The air condition did not work and even the window did not open. The steering wheel was dirty and nobody cared. I did not like the experience of driving at all.
Now am asking you to return my money back or I want you to give me a new contamporary car and a professional instructor. I have paid you a lot and I think that I deserve it.

Regards,
Dmitrii
